# Blob-Tracker

Blob tracking is a computer vision technique that detects and outlines regions of a video/photo. A unique application of blob tracking is its use as a visual effect in video editing. A common way to achieve this effect is through TouchDesigner, an application used for creating real-time interactive multimedia. I've always wanted to use this visual effect in my video editing, until I realized how difficult TouchDesigner was, so I decided to create this effect myself using Haar cascades in OpenCV.
